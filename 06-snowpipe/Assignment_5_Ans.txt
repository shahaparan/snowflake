1. Whcih type of storage is used in snowflake and where the data stored internally?
	Snowflake stores data in cloud in micro partitions that are internally compressed and optimized
	to stores data in columnar format. Micro partitions are physical storage unit of size ranges from 50-500 MB.
	Snowflake uses metadata (data about a table) for fast retrival of data. When a query is executed instead of visiting all partitions, the metadata determines which micro partitions to visit to get the data.

2. What fields you can choose as cluster keys for a table in snowflake?
	column(s) used mostly in where clause of select statement and fields used as join keys

3. Write the syntax to specify cluster keys for a table.
	1. While creating a table
		CREATE TABLE <Table_Name> (<Column_name> DATA_Type,
						 	<Column_name> DATA_Type,
							...)
		CLUSTER BY (<Column_name(s)>);

	2. In any existing table:
		ALTER TABLE <Table_Name>
		CLUSTER BY (<Column_name(s)>);


4. What are the storage plans available in Snowflake?
	Snowflake has 2 storage plans:
	1. On Demand Storage - This is a fexible plan in which pay as you use model is implemented. Customer are charged at a fixed rate of $4o/TB per month. 
	   This type of plan is generally used during the initial phase of any project when the customer is not sure of his total storage needs. 
	2. Capacity or Fixed storage - This is pre purchased plan in which some fixed storage is purchased from Snowflake by the customer. The charges are $23/TB per month.

5. Write a copy command to process below JSON file data. file_name 'languages.json'
	{
		"name":"Krishna",
		"gender":"Male",
		"languages":["English","Telugu","Hindi"],
		"Phone":{
					"Work": 123456789,
					"Mobile": 987654321
				}
	  }

	//Create a named stage
	CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE myown_db.public.named_stage;

	//Put your files into named internal stage
	put file://C:\Users\Files\languages.json @myown_db.public.named_stage;
	
	//create File format
	create or replace file format json_format type = 'json';

	--Creating Stage Table to store RAW Data	
	CREATE OR REPLACE Temporary TABLE MYOWN_DB.public.Languages_Raw
	(Person variant);


	--Copy the RAW data into a Stage Table
	COPY INTO MYOWN_DB.public.Languages_Raw 
    FROM myown_db.public.named_stage/languages.json
    file_format= json_format;

	create or replace table myown_db.public.EMPLOYEE as
	select  
       Person:name::string as Name,
       Person:gender::string as Gender,
       f1.value::string as Language,
	  Person:Phone.Work::number as Work_Phone,
	  Person:Phone.Mobile::number as Mobile_Phone
	FROM MYOWN_DB.public.Languages_Raw , 
	table(flatten(Person:Languages)) f1;

select * from myown_db.public.EMPLOYEE;

6. What is the diff between external stage and internal stage?
	Snowflake use stages(database object created in a schema) to store data. There are two type of stages:
	1.External Stage - External stage is the storage space present outside the snowflake environment in any of the 3 cloud providers. 
			A storage integration object is created to store the settings (ARN, URL, etc) of the cloud provider. 
	Internal Stage -Internal stage is the storage space inside the snowflake environment where before copying the data into tables, files are uploaded first from local disk/machine using SnowSql. 
			There are three types of internal stages:
			1. User Internal Stage associated with a particular snowflake user
			2. Table Internal Stage associated with any table in snowflake database
			3. Named Internal Stage where any number of user(s) can store files for any number of table(s)

	2. Internal stage copy is faster as the file is present in the local storage space whereas in external stage the files can be present in any other region geographically.
	3.External stage are costlier as cloud providers charge for the storage space across regions whereas for internal stage a minimal cost is applied.
	4.An external software SnowSQL is required to put files in internal stage whereas in external stage the user has to just upload the file.
	5.In exteranl stage the uploaded file after use can be archived on the provider side whereas in internal stage case the file after use is deleted.

7. What are the external stages supported by snowflake? (Which cloud providers)
	Snowflake supports all the three cloud providers as external storage:
		-Amazon Web Services
		-Microsoft Azure
		-Google Cloud Platform

8. Write a command to push a file from loacl system to user stage in snowflake.
	put file://<file path> @~/staged;

9. Write a query to create to list all files under the table stage for table 'ORDER_DTL'
	list @%ORDER_DTL;

10. Write a query to create named internal stage object.
	CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE <Database Name>.<Schema Name>.<Stage Name>;
